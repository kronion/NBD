#### *Forging independent paths -- together.*
{: id="mantra"}

## Our Mission

We're here to create a community for students trying to "figure it all out." For students, from students: to inspire, support, and challenge each other to seek a path that is right for each individual --  and to do so deliberately, with excitement, and **not by default**.

## Origin of the project

We've all heard the question, "Why do so many Ivy League graduates go (resignedly-so) into investment banking?” Generalize that to banking, consulting, big tech, startups, med school, and you have a list of "traditional" paths - each offering amazing jobs for many individuals, but wrong for others. 

This fall, as yet another wave of Senior Year Life Crisis washed over campus, we couldn't ignore the call for help: "I didn't like this job/internship/company, but I don't know what else I could do." We began to wonder, what would it take to make a difference?

Let's "un-box" each other. I am an outdoorsy type afraid of bugs; an inspired writer by night, management coach by day, and engineer at heart; a feminist who believes that chivalry and equality should coexist. I love the whisper of sea breeze through palm trees, the crash of waves on soft sand; the regal, winding streets of London, the ridiculously impressive stone-on-stone feats of ancient Roman construction. A Beijing/ Portland/ NorCal transplant to NYC, I love spicy food (Sichuanese), hilltops overlooking assorted skyscrapers (Dolores Park), and stories of people, neighborhoods, and history. I am a product of amazingly giving educators, both inside the classroom and out, and I believe an inspiring education for every child is absolutely worth fighting for. I am an explorer, a homebody, a proud big sister, ed techie, loyal friend, amateur stargazer, and most of all, your friendly, non-heteronormative dreamer-next-door.

What are you most afraid of? My answer used to be spiders, but since attending Princeton I've grown to fear complexity. As a computer scientist, I search for methods to manage complexity wherever it may be found. Some particular topics of interest include community formation, data curation, and the difficulty of high-yield communication. I believe in building tools and testing theories. Success is the story of learning from failure. I'm inspired by poets, painters, and all who dedicate their lives to creating order where none existed. In my free time, I juggle, write, and play poker. I love hearing stories and sometimes sharing my own.

Hello – my name is Raymond. I’m interested in how people understand the world around them: from the ways we consume information in the classroom and in our everyday lives, to all the ways we communicate and learn to understand each other through the written word and human interaction. At Princeton I’ve studied computer science, the history of technology, human values and perception, and social systems, and I’ve also helped build tools and organizations using what I’ve learned. I’m inspired by great minds and expressive artists, people who show us thoughts and feelings we would have wanted to think or feel, but wouldn’t have until we’d read or seen them.
